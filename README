I have created this app so i could have a cross-platform way of viewing
a magnet link archive.

This app can open the following magnet archive:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7016365/The_whole_Pirate_Bay_magnet_archive

I haven't tested the code on other archive, but theoretically it can open any
other one that uses the same format.

To use it, just run app.py (yes, it's in Python), or the MAV scripts (.command
for mac or .cmd for windows).

After the app is opened, type something in the search and wait for the results
to appear in your favourite browser. =)

The app will only work if there's an archive file in the folder, called
"content". You just need to get an archive (for example, the one mentioned
above), and decompress it to this folder.

Have fun!
