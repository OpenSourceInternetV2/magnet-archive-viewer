I have created this app so i could have a cross-platform way of viewing
a magnet link archive.

This app can open the following magnet archive:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7016365/The_whole_Pirate_Bay_magnet_archive

I haven't tested the code on other archive, but theoretically it can open any
other one that uses the same format.

To use it, follow these steps:

1) Download the project (click the ZIP button above)

2) Download the archive at
   http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7016365/The_whole_Pirate_Bay_magnet_archive

3) Unzip the archive to the same folder as this file. You should see a file
   called "content". THE APP WON'T WORK WITHOUT THIS FILE.

4) Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. If you have a mac or linux it
   should already be there.

5) Run app.py, or the MAV scripts (MAV.command for mac or MAV.cmd for windows).

6) After the app is opened, type something in the search and wait for the
   results to appear in your favourite browser. =)

Have fun!
